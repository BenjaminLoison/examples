# Bitcoin Wallet Example

## Summary

This example dapp shows how to build a Bitcoin wallet making use of the [Bitcoin intergration](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/developers-guide/concepts/bitcoin-integration.html).

This dapp is under active development and not ready to be used yet.
<!--Once some parts of its functionality are implemented, this README will be updated accordingly with instructions on how to build and run the dapp.-->

## Usage

The following commands will start a replica, install the development Internet Identity canister, and deploy the Bitcoin wallet webapp:

```bash
$ dfx start --background --clean
$ npm install
$ dfx deploy --argument '(null)'
```
